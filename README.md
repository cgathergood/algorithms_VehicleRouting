# algorithms_VehicleRouting
University Coursework, my solution for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem.

The report details the development process and results. If you want to look at my algorithm in full you can find it in VRSolution.java called mySolver().

If you want to run the code to see it for yourself, add all of the files to an eclipse project then run MkProblem.java. This will create the test problems. Once you have these you can run VRSolution.java and VRTests.java.

The approach I took focuses more on speed than keeping the overall route cost down. It scales very well on larger problems without taking too long.
